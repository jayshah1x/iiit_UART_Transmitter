# IIITB_UART_Transmitter -> Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter Protocol based Hardware Transmitter

This project simulates the designed UART Transmitter module which is used to transmit a data packet between devices using Asynchronous and Serial communication.The data length can vary from 5 bit to 8 bit but it must be decided before the communication begins along with the baud rate(in this case the baud rate is 115200).

# Introduction

UART is a Hardware based digital communication protocol used to transmit data between two device at an agreeded upon baud rate and data length.
